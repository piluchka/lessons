            <div class="gorilla-intro-img"><img src="img/gorilla-main.jpg" alt="gorilla is thinking"></div>
            <p>Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as laughter and
               sadness. In fact, gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, making them our closest cousins
               after chimpanzees and bonobos. </p>
            <p>
            <p> <mark>The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large,
                  human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in equatorial
                  Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. </mark> </p>

         <div id="gorilla-family">
            <h2 class="gorilla-family-title"> Do gorillas live alone? </h2>
            <p>Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two to more than 50, led by a
               dominant adult male—or silverback—who holds his position for years. The bond between the silverback and
               his females forms the basis of gorilla social life. Females become sexually mature around seven or eight
               years old but don’t begin to breed until a couple of years later. Males mature at an even greater age.
               Once a female begins to breed, she'll likely give birth to only one baby every four to six years and only
               three or four over her entire lifetime. </p>

         </div>
         <div id="gorilla-lifetime">
            <h2 class="gorilla-lifetime-title">How many years do gorillas live?</h2>
            <p> In the wild, gorillas can live to over 40 years old. Gorillas are classed as infants until they reach
               around three-and-a-half years old, and adults from around 8 years. Males between 8-12 years are called
               'blackbacks'. Then from 12 years old, they develop a silver section of hair over their back and hips,
               earning them the name '<span class="spacing">silverback</span>'. </p>

         <div id="gorilla-under-threat">
            <h2 class="gorilla-under-threat-title">Does wildlife crime affect gorillas?</h2>
            <p>The main threat to mountain gorillas is the degradation of their habitat. As the region’s population
               grows, the land is increasingly converted for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources
               leads to deforestation. <span class="line-through">With little other choice</span>, people enter mountain
               gorilla forests to collect water and firewood, putting gorillas at risk from human contact and illnesses.
               People may also lay snares intended for bushmeat, which can accidentally injure the great apes. </p>
            <p>Gorillas don’t just stay in their forests. They venture onto farmland to eat crops like maize and
               bananas, which can cause conflict with <span class="line-through">people</span> who need to make a
               living. </p>
            <p>Gorilla tourism that isn’t well managed is another potential issue, as it can impact the behaviour and
               health of mountain gorillas. </p>
